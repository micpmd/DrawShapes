# cs220-drawshapes-sol

## What to do

1. Add at least one more type of shape (triangle, star, polygon, etc)
1. Allow the user to select shapes by clicking on them, or by clicking and dragging such as you would do on a desktop
1. Selected shapes should be visually different (different color, highlighted border, etc)
1. Allow the user to modify selected shapes by changing the color, location, and size of the shape
1. Add some other features that sound exciting. Some possibilities include deleting shapes, re-ordering shapes, including new menu options, using keyboard events, supporting colors using hexadecimal RGB values, drawing arbitrary polygons formed by clicking a bunch of points, and so on.
1. This is very important: Include some kind of help option that explains what all of the buttons do. If the user can't figure something out, then your company might not get paid (or in an acdemic setting you might get a bad grade).
1. Make a Youtube video demonstrating the features of your DrawShapes assignment.
